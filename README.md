# Curious Agents
This repo explores various unsupervised and self-supervised methods in the reinforcement learning space. The main idea is that an agent first explores and learns to understand an environment without explicit rewards provided to it. Then afterwards it can be fine-tuned using a reward signal. The goal is 1.) to see if this approach works in large open world examples and 2.) to see whether this approach scales better than training from scratch.

Note. The base algorithm was adapted from https://github.com/luchris429/purejaxrl. Please check their GitHub repo out.
